## Project Title:  

Ground Changes after Coseismic landslides in Kaikoura New Zealand

## Name(s) of individual or team members: 

Luis Angel Guerrero Hoyos, Paul Morgan, Alan Viola

## Short 1-2 sentence summary: 

## Some introductory background information: 

On 14 November 2016, the region surrounding Kaikoura, New Zealand, experienced a M7.8 earthquake which triggered over 10,000 landslides. The modes of landsliding were diverse, including shallow, soil slides; rock avalanches and rock falls; and massive, deep-seated rotational slumps (Massey et al., 2018). Extensive mapping of the landslides triggered by the November 2016 earthquake has been undertaken by the New Zealand Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS).

Over the years, the GNS has done LiDAR and UAV - SfM surveys in the area that will serve as the main dataset to develop the project. The main goal is to track ground changes after the coseismic landslides, see how they’ve progressed over time, and find geospatial correlations between ground changes. We will focus on the LIDAR dataset collected by GNS between 2016 and 2019 and use the difference maps technique to identify the potential movements.


## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)

- How have ground changes progressed over time in the Keikoura region?
- How do properties like vegetation, slope, aspect ratio, and position relative to ridges and valleys affect ground changes after landslides?
